# About

Hi, I'm Konstantin Makushev, a technical writer. I have made this website made as a test task for the Latenode TW position â€” to prepare documentation according to the [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsPWwsHHF0).

To find the result, see the [Overview](./concepts/overview.md) section and [Your first personal assistant](./basic_tutorials/first_pa.md) tutorial.

The site also contains some of my considerations regarding the possible target structure of the whole Latenode Opensource documentation.
