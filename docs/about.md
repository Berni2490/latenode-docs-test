_Information about the Latenode team, contacts, careers and so on_

Hi, I'm [Konstantin Makushev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantin-makushev-544ba6288/), a technical writer. I have made this website as a test task for the TW position at Latenode. The task was to prepare documentation on the base of the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsPWwsHHF0).

To see the result, refer to the [Your first personal assistant](./basic_tutorials/first_pa.md) tutorial.

The site also includes some of my thoughts on the potential target structure for the entire Latenode Open Source documentation. You can find them in the [Organization of the documentation](./index.md#organization) section.
