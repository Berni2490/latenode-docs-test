_Information about the Latenode team, contacts, careers and so on_

Hi, I'm [Konstantin Makushev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantin-makushev-544ba6288/), a technical writer. I have made this website as a test task for the TW position at Latenode. The task was to prepare documentation on the base of the [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsPWwsHHF0).

To find the result, see [Your first personal assistant](./basic_tutorials/first_pa.md) tutorial.

The site also contains some of my considerations regarding the possible target structure of the whole Latenode Opensource documentation. You may find it in the [Organization of the documentation](./index.md#organization) section.

!!! note

    All the presented information is already freely available at the moment of its publication on this site. As so, I handle this information as non-confidential and reserve the right to use this site further as an example of my work.

    If you have any objections on this matter, please contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantin-makushev-544ba6288/) or Telegram (`@mkm0190`).
