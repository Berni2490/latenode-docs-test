# Latenode Documentation Test Task

Hi, I'm Konstantin Makushev, a technical writer. I have made this website as a test task for the Latenode TW position â€” to prepare documentation according to the [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsPWwsHHF0).

To find the result, see [GitHub Pages](https://berni2490.github.io/latenode-docs-test/) and take a look at the **Overview** section and **Your first personal assistant** tutorial.

The site also contains some of my considerations regarding the possible target structure of the whole Latenode Opensource documentation.
