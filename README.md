# Latenode Documentation Test Task

Hi, I'm [Konstantin Makushev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantin-makushev-544ba6288/), a technical writer. I have made this website as a test task for the TW position at Latenode. The task was to prepare documentation on the base of the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsPWwsHHF0).

To see the result, see [GitHub Pages](https://berni2490.github.io/latenode-docs-test/) and refer to the **Your first personal assistant** tutorial.

The site also includes some of my thoughts on the potential target structure for the entire Latenode Open Source documentation. You can find them in the **Organization of the documentation** section at the main page.
